<h1 align="center">Portfolio website | Juan Stelling</h1>

![Portfolio website](readme-testing/portfoliowebsite-responsive.png)

This website presents my portfolio website, to present myself as a web developer. 
I wanted a portfolio website for a while but never started it. This project was a good opportunity to create my portfolio website with a self-written code, to show my skills. 
The website shows my resume, where you get to know me more. The website provides information about my skills, education and personal information. 

This project is the first of four Milestone Projects in the Full Stack Web Development Program I am attending at The Code Institute.

<h1>1. User experience (UX)</h1>

<span id="ux-goals"></span>

### 1.1 Project goals 

- Making a static front-end site to present useful information to users/ recruitments, using all technologies that I have learned about so far. (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and user experience/design) 
- Creating a website that is easy to navigate and easy to understand. 
- The customer experience has to be great on every device and internet browser.
- I am creating a portfolio website to show my skills, experiences, creativity and competencies to present myself and to get hired. 
- The portfolio website is for recruiters and the tech industry, who want to know more about me.

<span id="ux-stories"></span>

### 1.2 User stories 

#### First time visitors goals 
1. As a first time visitor, I want  the website scales on every device, so that I can look at the website on desktop, mobile and tablet. 
2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate easily through the website. 
3. As a first time visitor, I want to know more about the person, so that I get a feeling by the person. 
4. As a first time visitor, I want to see the skills and education of the person, so that I know what the web developer can do.
5. As a first time visitor, I want to know which projects the person has done, so that I know the level of experience of the person. 

#### Returning visitors goals
1. As a returning visitor, I want to know how I can contact the person for potential projects/ more information so that I can reach out to that person. 
2. As a returning visitor, I want to find the social links of the person on the website so that I can see the socials of the person. 
3. As a returning visitor, I want to know more information about the projects the person has done so that I know the level of experience of the person. 

<span id="ux-design"></span>

### 1.3 Design 

- #### Colour scheme 
The two main colours that are used are:
- ![#fddf3f](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fddf3f/000000?text=+) #fddf3f (Yellow)
- ![#312c2c](https://via.placeholder.com/15/312c2c/000000?text=+) #312c2c (Dark Gray)

I have chosen these colours because I already used these colours for my portfolio that I made in university. The yellow colour represents optimism and energy. Other terms I associate with yellow are wisdom growing. The dark gray colour is chosen because this is slightly softer than the colour black and with this colour, I wanted to create a contrast between a bright and dark colour. 

- #### Typography 
The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole portfolio website. Sans Serif is the fallback in case the main font isn’t being imported to the site correctly. Roboto is chosen for its clean and calm design. 

- #### Imagery
All images are personal images, to make a personal ambiance of the developer. With the imagery, it has been taken into account that the colours in the image match with the yellow colour of the website. The images are square (except for the project images) to make the website sleek.

<span id="ux-wireframes"></span>

### 1.4 Wireframes 
Instead of wireframes, I preferred to make mockups. I used mockups to fleshes out the static visual look of the site. The mockups are made with [Figma.](https://www.figma.com/)

Click on the links below to see the mockups in Figma.
